# SENTIMENTAL_ANALYSIS
Sentiment Analysis Using Machine Learning

This project implements a Sentiment Analysis system that classifies textual data into sentiment categories such as positive, negative, or neutral using machine learning techniques. The objective is to analyze user-generated text (such as reviews or comments) and automatically determine the underlying sentiment.

The notebook covers the complete NLP pipeline, starting from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation. Text data is cleaned, tokenized, and transformed into numerical features using vectorization techniques. Machine learning classifiers are then trained to learn sentiment patterns from the data.

Key Features

Text preprocessing (lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopword removal)

Feature extraction using techniques like Bag of Words / TF-IDF

Model training using machine learning algorithms

Performance evaluation using accuracy and classification metrics

Modular and easy-to-understand Jupyter Notebook implementation

Technologies Used

Python

Jupyter Notebook

NumPy, Pandas

Scikit-learn

Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Use Cases

Product and service review analysis

Social media sentiment monitoring

Customer feedback analysis

Opinion mining for decision support systems

Project Outcome

The system successfully demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to textual data to extract meaningful sentiment insights, making it useful for real-world applications in analytics and decision-making.
